    "[jdaviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a package of astronomical data analysis visualization tools based on the Jupyter platform. These GUI-based tools link data visualization and interactive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`jdaviz` includes several tools. Here, we will focus on using `Imviz`, which is a tool for visualization and quick-look analysis for 2D astronomical images, so it can be used to analyze images, create and modify regions files such as those needed in many X-ray analysis pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through the simple steps of using `Imviz` on sciserver. For more details on using the tool, please refer to the main [jdaviz site](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "Say we are analyzing NuSTAR data of some point source and we want to extract the spectra. We typically need to either pass the source and background selection as RA and DEC positions along with selection region information such as the radius, or we can create the region files for the source and backgorund and pass those to the extraction pipeline. In this example, we will use the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this example, we will copy the cleaned event file for the FMPA detector from the archive. We will use observation `60001084002` of `3C 382`.\n",
