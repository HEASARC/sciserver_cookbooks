    "In this example, a user has a catalog of several thousand sources they are interested in.  They'd like to find out if they've been observed by HEASARC missions and what the total exposure each sources has for that mission.  This can be done in a variety of inefficient ways such as writing a script to call one of the HEASARC APIs for each of the sources.  But we encourage users to discover the power of querying databases with SQL.  \n",
